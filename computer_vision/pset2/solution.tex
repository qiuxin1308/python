\solution{1}
\spart{a} Based on the slides of lecture 6, the derivative of the cost function is:
$$
2(x - y) + \lambda|\cdot|
$$
then there are three ways to minimize the cost function as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item when $x > 0$, then we have $y - \frac{\lambda}{2} > 0$, so the minimum is $\lambda y + \frac{3\lambda^2}{4}$.
\item when $x < 0$, then we have $y + \frac{\lambda}{2} < 0$, so the minimum is $-\lambda y - \frac{\lambda^2}{4}$.
\item when $x = 0$, then we have $y - \frac{\lambda}{2} \le 0$ and $y + \frac{\lambda}{2} \ge 0$, so the minimum is $y^2$.
\end{enumerate}

 By observing the different between part (a) and part (b), I realized that the figures in part (a) are more affected by the dominant color then the figures in part (b). Take the first image as an example, the original image has so many green pixels, which presents too green. So, for the first algorithm, the mean value of green channel would be higher than red channel and blue channel, and more green intensity would be filter out when multiplied by the inverse mean. And also for the second algorithm, the three factors would be very close to 1 while we take the 10\% highest three colors intensity values, then as for the first image, less green intensity would be filter out. And images in part(b) are more closer to real images. This also works for the rest of two pairs.
